title: 'Open source at Philips'

## 1. Purpose

This document has been created by the Philips [Open Source Team](#contact) and publicly describes Philips policy on open sourcing (publishing).

Philips employees: please read the [internal version](https://gitlab.ta.philips.com/open-source/howto-open-source), which contains additional instructions and a few internal links.

## 2. Motivation

Open source software and the principles of the open source software development model are well in line with the Philips Accelerate program. Using and contributing to open source software provides an opportunity for Philips to delight our customers by reducing time to market and product development costs.

### 2.1 Publication via github

For now, open source projects release by and maintained by Philips will be available via this github account.

### 2.2 License

Unless stated otherwise, Philips contributions are licensed under the [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html).
